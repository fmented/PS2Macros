# PS2Macros

turn ps2 keyboards into macro keyboards using Arduino Uno.
>
in this case I'm using 2 PS2 Keyboards and two self-lock buttons as a multiplexer.
>
so I got (208 keys * 4 channels) 832 programmable keys

    I'm not a real programmer and I know it isn't the good way to program,
    but it still works.
    maybe some of you could help me to make it better in a correct way.
    Thanks.

    to remap your keyboard, go to customkey.h
   https://github.com/fmented/PS2Macros/blob/master/macro/customkey.h
    
and

    change the value to any key you want to send
    for key definitions you can see at keytab.h
   https://github.com/fmented/PS2Macros/blob/master/macro/keytab.h
    



to send a keystroke, you can use:
>
sendKey();
>
if you use sendKey(); make sure to use releaseKey(); everytime you send a keystroke, 
>
otherwise it can causes an error to your computer.
>
or you can simply use pressKey(*modifier* , *key* ); so you don't need to worry if you forgot to releaseKey(); 
>
if you want to type some texts you can use wordKey("*your text*");
>
>

    note: Please done your code before you flash your arduino.
